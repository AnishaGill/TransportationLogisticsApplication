## Transportation Logistics Application

### For trucking organization


The Transportation Logistics Application will be a way for trucking operation administration to *organize* and keep
*track* of all their shipments. The application will allow trucking managers to create shipments and view all shipments 
on a readable interface. A shipment is created by entering the rate that the driver will be paid, date and location of 
pick-up, and drop-off, goods to be transported, and lastly, driver name. The application will assign a unique Trip 
Number to each shipment when created, allowing users to also search shipments by Trip Number. Users will also be able 
to print the dispatch to be sent to a driver and will also be able to mark loads as completed. 

I decided to design this application as my family operates a transportation logistics company and uses a robust 
trucking software to manage our highway trucks. Over the years I have noticed some design choices that 
different needs.
